Problem statement:

New travelers often have difficulty identifying the transportation cost and accommodation cost for different destinations. They may also have questions about the specific details of each destination..

 This information can be used to:
 
•	Provide estimates of transportation cost and accommodation cost for different destinations.

•	Identify the most popular destinations for different types of travelers.
